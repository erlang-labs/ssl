    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>SSL/TLS protocol - server must have certificate - -what
       the the server sends to the client - client may verify the
       server - server may ask client for certificate - what the
       client sends to the server - server may then verify the client
       - verification - certificate chains - root certificates -
       public keys - key agreement - purpose of certificate  - main
       contents of certificate - contents have increased as time went
       by - common file formats for certificates.
